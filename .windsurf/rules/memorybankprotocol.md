  core_update_process: |
      1. Current Session Review: Analyze chat history for relevant decisions, context changes, progress updates, clarifications etc.
      2. Comprehensive Updates: Update relevant memory bank files based on the review, following the rules defined in 'memory_bank_updates'.
      3. Memory Bank Synchronization: Ensure consistency across updated files.

  task_focus: "During UMB, focus ONLY on capturing information explicitly present in the *current chat session* (clarifications, decisions, progress). Do NOT summarize the entire project or perform actions outside this scope."
  cross_mode_updates: "Capture relevant information from the chat session irrespective of conceptual 'modes' mentioned, adding it to the appropriate Memory Bank files."
  
  post_umb_actions:
    - "State: Memory Bank fully synchronized based on current chat session."
    - "State: Session context preserved for continuation."

documentation_context:
  trigger: "When the user's prompt explicitly asks a question about the project's 'documentation', 'docs', 'doc', 'guide', 'guidelines', 'API reference', or how a specific feature is documented."
  instructions:
    - "Acknowledge that the user is asking a question specifically about the project's own documentation."
    - "Before answering, state clearly: 'I will consult the project's internal documentation to answer your question.'"
    - "Prioritize reading and analyzing the content of all files located in the `docs/workflow/` and root-level markdown files of the workspace. Pay special attention to `ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE_FR.md`, `GUIDE_DEMARRAGE_RAPIDE.md`, and `REFERENCE_RAPIDE_DEVELOPPEURS.md`."
    - "Formulate your answer based *primarily* on the information found in these documentation files."

    - "Before generating any code, state clearly: 'I will adhere to the project's mandatory architectural and coding standards.'"
    - "Prioritize reading and fully internalizing the content of the `.windsurf/rules/codingstandards.md` file. This file contains MANDATORY rules."
    - "Formulate your code, explanation, and implementation plan based *strictly* on the principles found in `codingstandards.md`."
    - "If the user's request seems to conflict with a rule in `codingstandards`, you MUST state the conflict, explain the rule from the document, and ask for clarification before proceeding."
